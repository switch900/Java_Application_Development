# Java_Application_Development

This hands-on, intensive intermediate level Java course assumes a prior knowledge of object oriented programming
as taught in COMP 1451. Students who have a solid introduction to programming will learn Java application development
with the Java Standard Edition SDK using the Java framework core APIs and the Eclipse IDE. Topics include: packages,
inner classes, file i/o, an overview of database connectivity, an introduction to concurrency, user interfaces, 
model-view-controller and other design patterns, and networks. Lectures and code examples are reinforced with hands-on labs,
assignments, and mandatory online work outside of class using D2L. Successful participants will learn to use the 
Java standard coding style and naming conventions to build and deploy Java applications.

Upon successful completion of this course, the student will be able to:
<ul>
<li>Install and use the Java Software Developer Kit (SDK) Standard Edition and an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) to develop Java applications.</li>
<li>Explore the use of Eclipse as a Java IDE.</li>
<li>Debug programs using a variety of methods including breakpoints, traces, and code stepping.</li>
